# GTKonfig
GTK+and Rust powered config file manager for Linux

## Goal 
Provide an easier interface for beginner users to "rice" Linux. With GTKonfig, users should be
able to easily use premade set ups with the support of the creators. Dotfiles will be stored
similary to the way wpgtk handles them, with .base being generated for each specific config,
permitting creators to sync them with GTKonfig and offer easier customization to others who want
to utilize the setup through GUI. This will not be a simpler way for experienced users to set up their 
system, but an easier way for them to share it.
